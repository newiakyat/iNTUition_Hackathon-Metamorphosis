The impurities were found in several \nmedications that contained the active ingredient valsartan, \nwhich is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. \nOther drugs containing the same active ingredient or related \ncompounds were also found to be contaminated, leading to \nrecalls and supply chain disruptions. \nThe impurities were traced back to changes made by certain \nmanufacturers in their manufacturing processes, which led to \nthe formation of the impurities.
