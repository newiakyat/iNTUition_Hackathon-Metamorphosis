exciting turn in 2023. \nBack when Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test in 1950, it established a benchmark to \ndetermine whether a computer has reached a level of excellence such that even a human could \nnot tell man and machine apart. Yet, despite the buzz in the early years with some of the best \ntalents working in the field, no real sophisticated AI machines emerged that were powerful enough \nto pass it, let alone give the Turing Test a good challenge. However, science fiction has constantly \nfed us with the vision of sentient AI that can interact with us just like another human being. We\u2019ve \nseen the various portrayals of the AI, either in robotic form or as faceless software - powerful and \nknowledgeable like Hal 9000 in A Space Odyssey, useful and servile like Iron Man\u2019s Jarvis, or \ndestructive and malicious like Skynet or Ultron.

This means that an object will \ncontinue to move in a straight line at a constant speed unless a force acts upon \nit to change its motion. For example, a book sitting on a table will remain there \nuntil someone picks it up or pushes it off. \nThe second law , also known as the law of acceleration, states that the \nacceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied to it, and \ninversely proportional to its mass.

The prompts can be anything from a short phrase to a full sentence or even a \nparagraph. The goal of prompt engineering is to design prompts that will produce high-quality, relevant, \nand coherent responses from the model.\nThere are several di\ufb00erent techniques and strategies that can be used in prompt engineering, including:\n\u2022 Keyword-based prompts: These prompts use speci\ufb01c keywords or phrases to prompt the \nmodel to generate text related to a particular topic or concept.\n\u2022 Template-based prompts: These prompts use pre-de\ufb01ned templates or structures to guide \nthe model in generating text.

It enables \nyou to interact with machine learning models in a more natural and intuitive way and elicit powerful \nresults that will save you time and money and, in many cases, far exceed previous outcomes.\nFor example, prompt engineering can enhance your ability to create content by providing you with a \npowerful tool for generating text.
